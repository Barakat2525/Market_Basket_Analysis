# Market_Basket_Analysis
This project contains the code and data for performing Market Basket Analysis(MBA) using the Apriori algorithm. Apriori is a technique used in retail and e-commerce to discover patterns and relationships between products that are frequently purchased together. 
# Introduction
Market Basket Analysis is a crucial aspect of understanding customer behavior, allowing businesses to optimize product placements, marketing strategies, and promotions. This repository provides a Python implementation of the Apriori algorithm for mining association rules from a transaction dataset.
#Requirements
To run the code in this repository, I had the following installed:
Python
NumPy
Pandas
# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is included in the data directory.
# Algorithm
The Apriori algorithm is implemented in the apriori_algorithm.py script. The script provides a modular implementation, making it easy to adjust parameters such as minimum support, confidence and lift thresholds.
# Results
The results of the Market Basket Analysis, including discovered association rules and support/confidence metrics, will be displayed in the console.
